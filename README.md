# Dataset Used:
For this application, we used these datasets from Kaggle:
* [Breast Cancer Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset)
* [Diabetes Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

# ML Algorithms Used:
* For Breast-Cancer dataset, we used [Random Forest](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2) and achieved an accuracy of 92%. 
* For Diabetes dataset, we used [Logistic Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-detailed-overview-46c4da4303bc) and achieved an accuracy of nearly 80%.

## Well that's great! But how do I make my own API?:
* This project demonstrates a swift and prompt way of deploying your ML models, which is very important if you aim to push your ML models into production.
* To add your own models and prediction, follow this [comprehensive guide](https://medium.com/dsc-vit-bhopal/deployment-of-ml-models-using-flask-jackson-jacob-6459f4e7c526). In case of any doubts, feel free to reach us on our Discord server.
